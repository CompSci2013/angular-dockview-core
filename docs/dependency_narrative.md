**3. Dependency Narrative**

The **Dependency Narrative** describes how features in the **Feature Matrix** build on one another:

1. **Foundational Layer**
   - **Views (Splitview & Gridview)** are the very first feature to implement—they provide the container framework for everything else.
   - **Theming & Styles** can be integrated in parallel or later, since they don’t affect core behavior.

2. **Core Panel Management**
   - Once you have views, you can add and remove panels/groups (**Panel & Group Add/Remove**).
   - With panels present, you expose which one is currently in focus (**Active Panel/Group Changes**).

3. **Advanced Interaction**
   - Building on add/remove, you wire up **Drag-and-Drop Docking**, letting users rearrange panels visually.
   - **Floating & Pop-out Windows** is a special case of docking: panels become their own floating “views,” so you need drag/drop plus the ability to detach a panel into a new window.

4. **State Serialization**
   - **Serializable Layouts** sits atop everything: it snapshots views, panel positions, active states, and floating windows into JSON and can rehydrate them.
   - You can start with serializing just views and panel placements early, then layer in active-state and pop-out details as those features come online.
